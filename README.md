# N-Queens-Problem-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

This is a Meta-heuristic approach for solving the N-Queens Problem to find the
best possible solution in a reasonable amount of time. This method is computationally more efficient than the traditional methods like Gradient Descent, Dynamic Programming and Newton Methods.
This algorithm is studied from the abstract above and the algorithm is implimented in python.
Genetic Algorithm is used with a novel fitness function as the Meta-heuristic. 

The aim of N-Queens Problem is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard, in a way so
that no queen is in conflict with the others. Chromosome representation and genetic operations like Mutation
and Crossover are described in detail. Results show that this approach yields promising and satisfactory results
in less time compared to that obtained from the previous approaches for several large values of N.
